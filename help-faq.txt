   20. How can I improve my listening?  Answer
       You can improve by doing IELTS listening practice exercises: IELTS Listening Page. And you can develop by listening to a
       range of accents and topics. If you visit my “Useful Websites” page, you will see links to BBC news and other useful sites
       for listening. But remember that these sites will improve your listening ability but you will still need to work on listening
       skills for your IELTS test in order to listening for specific information and answers to questions.
   21. How can I improve section 4 of the listening test?Answer
       1) Section 4 is a lecture so that means it will be structured. The information will follow a normal pattern which you must
       try to follow. The speaker will move from point to point. Check your questions to see if they are a new point or examples
       etc. See the order of information in the questions. 2) You must build speed at preparing the questions for section 4. You
       must be able to read and prepare all questions in the time given. This is skill you must practice. Immediately underline key
       words which will help you follow the information coming. You should practice this skill again and again to improve. Always
       underline or circle the words which will help you locate your place in the listening. 3) Always keep your eye on more than
       one question at once. If you are listening for question 34, then you must also have your eye on question 35. When I say “keep
       your eye on” , I mean keep your mind open for the key words in the next question(s). 4) Some key words will be repeated but
       that doesn’t mean other key words will be. You must learn to identify which are useful key words and which are not. Any word
       that can’t be paraphrased will be useful to help you find your place in the talk. So, academic words, names, dates etc are
       all useful and can help you. 5) Listen for signposts. These are words which indicate when the speaker is repeating
       information, when the speaker is moving on to another point in the talk or just giving examples and details. Signposts are
       similar to linking devices “Another point to consider is…” or “if we look at the aspect of …”. Pay attention to these words.
   22. What does “two words and/or number” mean? Answer
       It means you can write two words with a number (for example “26 local men”) or you can just have a number. You can also have
       one word with a number. But you can’t have more than two words with a number. This is explained very clearly in the 25
       essential tips video for listening: http://ieltsliz.com/ielts-listening/.
   23. Should I use “the” or “a” with my answer? Answer
       If you are completing a sentence then you must make sure the sentence is grammatically correct when you fill in the answer.
       That means you might need to use articles (a / the). However, if you are only writing notes, forms or completing a table,
       diagram or flowchart, you won’t need to think about grammar.
   24. How can I write the time? 9am or 9.00am? Answer
       IELTS accept all forms of written time: 9AM, 9am, 9.00AM & 9.00am.
   25. If I write Northroad instead of North Road, is the answer correct? Answer
       No, it is wrong. If the answer contains two separate words, then they must be written separately. This is testing your
       spelling of compound nouns. 

   Reading and Listening

    1. If I use all capital letters in listening, do I need to do the same for reading? Answer
       No. For each part of the test, you decide if you want to use capital letters or lower case. This means you can use all
       capitals for listening and lower case for reading.

                                                    IELTS Reading Test Information

       It is recommended that you spend 20 minutes on each passage. I agree with this completely. Make sure you keep your eyes on
       the clock to make sure you manage your time effectively. Don’t leave yourself too little time for passage 3.
   11. What types of questions will I get in IELTS reading? Answer
       There are many different types of questions and you must practice all of them. Here’s a link to a page with a list of IELTS

       reading.

       the answer to be correct.
   14. Can I write all my answers in capital letters on my reading answer sheet? Answer
       Yes, you can. Sometimes this is a good idea because usually your writing will be easier to read and also you avoid the
       problem with remembering to put capital letters at the beginning of proper nouns.
   15. Should I use a pen or pencil? Answer
       For your reading and listening test, you must use a pencil. so don’t forget to take an eraser with you. However, for writing
       you can choose either pen or pencil.

       words.
   17. Can I write T instead of True for the True False Not Given questions? Answer
       Yes, it’s possible to write a letter instead of the word True or you can write Y instead of the word Yes. 
   18. Can I write Y instead of True for the True False Not Given questions? Answer
       No, you can only write Y for the word Yes. If you write Yes or Y instead of True or T, it will be marked wrong.
   19. How can I improve my reading skills? Answer
       Here are some tips for improving your reading skills for IELTS. (1) develop skills of each type of question in reading –
       focus on just one type of question each day to improve your technique. Follow the link to get information and tips on
       question types. (2) develop your speed reading skills –  the passages are long and time is limited so you need to build your
       speed. (3) develop your ability to scan – IELTS reading is not about understanding everything, it’s about locating answers.
       (4) read academic articles on various topics – read the bbc news, the new scientist, the economist etc. Here’s a link to a
       page with useful websites for IELTS. (5) practice – use my practice lessons to improve your techniques and skills
       (6) practice tests – do practice tests to develop your concentration, test your timing and to know your band score. You
       should take your practice tests from the IELTS Cambridge books 1-10 because they are real past exam papers.
   20. Do all answers come in order? Answer
       No, only some of the question types have answers which follow the order of information in the passage. You need to learn
       which ones do and don’t. Here is a link to read information and tips about the question types in IELTS reading.
   21. How can I improve my score for matching headings? Answer
       There are a number of issues with matching headings. Firstly, you need to identify the main point of the paragraph or
       section. The main point could be the first sentence, in the middle or at the end of the paragraph. This is testing your
       ability to see the difference between a main point and supporting points. Secondly, spend time looking more closely at the
       headings. Think of what they mean, paraphrase the words and spot headings which seem to be similar to each other. Thirdly,
       you don’t need to approach the headings in order. I recommend you start with a heading which is distinctly different in
       content to the others – it will be quicker and easier to find. Fourthly, don’t waste time, if you can’t match the heading,
       then move on to the next heading. There are often more headings than you actually need. Lastly, don’t just try to match key
       words, try to match meaning. If the heading says “A description of …”, then you need to look for a paragraph which contains
       adjectives and descriptive language rather than looking for the word “description”.  So, don’t just match key words, try to
       predict the type of language you might find in that paragraph. Follow the link to practice Matching Headings Questions.

       The academic paper is mostly for people who want to enter college or university. Most people take this paper. For this paper,

       questions – it depends on the length of your answers. Try to aim for long, detailed answers in part 3.
    7. Why do I need to expand my answers in my speaking test?
       To get band score 6 and above for the criterion of fluency, you must show the examiner that you are willing to speak at
       length. This means you are happy to give longer answers.
    8. Do I need to talk for 2 minutes in part 2?
       In part 2, you must talk for between 1 and 2 minutes. I recommended you aim for between 1.5 to 2 mins which will show a good
       level of fluency and the ability to speak at length. However, if you are not a confident speaker, don’t try to push it too
       far and just aim for slightly over 1 minute.
    9. What happens if I continue talking past 2 mins in speaking part 2?
       The examiner will control the time very strictly in your test. The examiner will stop you when you reach 2 minutes and then
       he/she will move on to part 3.
   10. Can I choose my topic to talk about in part 2?
       No, the examiner will give you a topic card which contains a list of prompts.
   11. Can I ask the examiner to change the topic is part 2 if I can't talk about it?
       No, you can’t change the topic. You must try to talk on the topic you are given.
   12. Do I need to follow the prompts on the cue card in speaking part 2?
       No, you don’t have to, it’s not compulsory. However, I recommend that you do follow the prompts because they offer a good
       structure for your talk. This is part of the criterion of fluency.
   13. What's the difference between part 1 and part 3 in the IELTS speaking test?
       Part 1 is like an interview. The examiner will ask you short answer questions on common topics relating to your life or your
       country. In part 3, it is more similar to a discussion. The examiner will ask you about world issues or broader, more complex
       questions. In part 3, your answers should be longer and more detailed.
   14. Should I give examples in my answers?
       Yes, it is very useful to do that, particularly in part 3 when you need to give longer, more detailed answers.
   15. What can I do if I don't understand the question?
       In speaking part 1, you can ask the examiner to repeat the question but the examiner can’t explain it or help you. In part 2,
       the examiner will give you a topic and you can’t change it. In part 3, you can ask the examiner to explain the question, just
       say ” I’m sorry could you explain that, please?
   16. Will I get a lower score if I ask the examiner to repeat the question?
       No, it will not affect your score. However, only do this two or three times and no more.
   17. What can I do if I don't have any ideas for the answer in part 3?
       It sometimes happens that you are asked a question for which you have no ideas. Here’s a typical example “How do you think
       space exploration benefits mankind?” If you get a question but you have no ideas for the answer, you can say “To be honest,
       I’ve never really thought about it before. I guess there are benefits to space exploration but I can’t say what they are.”
       This answer is still good. You are still using a range of good language.
   18. Does it matter if I have an accent when I talk?
       No, as long as the examiner can understand clearly. If your accent prevents the examiner from understanding you, it will
       lower your score drastically.
   19. Why did the examiner interrupt my answer?
        It is possible for the examiner to interrupt your answer and not let you finish. There are three main reasons why this might
       happen. Firstly, there is a time limit and the examiner must move on to the next question. Secondly, the examiner is
       satisfied with the language in your answer and wants to move quickly to a new question which tests another part of your
       English. Thirdly, your answer has gone off topic and the examiner wants to start a new question. So, if the examiner
       interrupts your answer, don’t worry about it. Just focus on the next question and answer confidently.
   20. Can I ask the examiner for his or her opinion?
       No, this is a language test, the examiner wants to hear your English and your opinions.
   21. Where can I get a practice speaking test from?
       Follow this link and you will be able to do a practice speaking test on video and then get a link to model answers.
   22. Should I correct my mistakes when I'm speaking in the test?
       It is ok to correct some mistakes but make sure it doesn’t affect your fluency. Every time you stop speaking to correct a
       mistake, it will affect your fluency score.
   23. How should I greet the examiner?
       When you walk into the speaking exam room, the examiner will greeting and do an ID check. Follow this link to learn all about
       the questions for the ID check and how to greet the examiner.
   24. What should I wear for my speaking test?
       You can wear whatever you want. This is not a formal interview, it is only a speaking test. Wear clothes that you are most
       comfortable in.
   25. What happens if my answer includes the answer to the next question on the examiner's list?
       The examiner has quite a long list of possible questions and they choose which questions to ask and which not to ask. So if
       you answer includes the answer to the next question on the examiner’s list, he or she will skip that question and move on to
       the question after that. So never worry about adding extra information to your answer – it won’t affect the next question.
   26. Can I use body language in my speaking test?
       The examiner is only interested in hearing your English language. It is your choice if you want to use body language or not.
       Most people find it natural to use body language while talking so feel free to use it. It is important that you are relaxed
       and talk naturally during your test.
