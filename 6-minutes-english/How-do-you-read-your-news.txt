   Sophie
   Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie…

   Neil
   And I'm Neil.

   Sophie
   What are you reading?

   Neil
   A news blog – it says here that the fossil of a two-headed dinosaur has been discovered in Greece. Look! Look at this picture!

   Sophie
   Honestly, Neil, you shouldn't believe everything you read on the internet! This story is from one of those fake news websites that float about
   on social media. And you aren't the only one to get taken in – even serious news channels report these types of stories as if they were true.

   Neil
   Taken in means fooled by something. Well, I must admit, I did believe it. And I didn't know that fake – or pretend – news sites existed. How am
   I supposed to know what's fake and what's real? So many extraordinary things happen!

   Sophie
   That's a good question, and actually, digital news and its effect on traditional newspapers is the subject of today's show. The thing is, if you
   read a traditional print newspaper like I do, you'd find stories that are more reliable – ones you can trust.

   Neil
   Well, enjoy your traditional print newspaper while you can, Sophie, because they're going to disappear pretty soon – the same way as the
   dinosaurs!

   Sophie
   Hmm. It is true that print newspapers are feeling the pinch these days – and that means not making enough money. But I will miss them if they
   go. Which brings me on to today's quiz question. Neil, how many national print newspapers are currently sold in the UK a day? Is it…
   a) 70,000?
   b) 700,000?
   Or c) 7 million?

   Neil
   Well, I'll go for a) 70,000. It can't be much more than that, surely.

   Sophie
   Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later in the show. But moving on now, we've discussed one disadvantage of digital
   news – that it can be hard to distinguish a real story from a fake one – given the mass of information available on the web. So maybe you should
   tell us about the advantages, Neil. 

   Neil
   Well, you can access news 24/7 – and search for it on your phone or tablet without having to flip through pages of stuff you aren't interested
   in. It isn't all in black and white, it isn't all about reading – you can watch and listen too. And make comments of your own.

   Sophie
   OK. Well, let's listen to Tim Luckhurst, Professor of Journalism at Kent University, to see what he thinks is important in journalism nowadays.

   INSERT
   Tim Luckhurst, Professor of Journalism at Kent University
   It doesn't matter whether your local journalist produces news on a tablet, on a mobile phone, in print, online, on television, or on radio. What
   matters is that there should be a diversity of journalism available and that it should be provided by professional reporters whose job is to do
   an honest objective job, impartially, in the public interest, not simply to rant or express opinions.

   Sophie
   Tim Luckhurst there. He says that news will be successful on any platform – digital or traditional – so long as reporters are honest and
   objective in their pursuit of a good story. If you're objective it means you aren't influenced by personal feelings or opinions. If you rant you
   speak in an angry opinionated way about something.

   Neil
   Now, newspapers need to make money in order to pay their journalists. And with circulation falling dramatically, they need to find other ways to
   make newspapers pay.

   Sophie
   A newspaper's circulation is the number of copies it distributes per day. Well, selling more advertising space is one way, isn't it?

   Neil
   Yes, but many advertisers are choosing to use digital platforms because they reach a wider and more targeted audience. And this is one reason
   why digital news is taking over – it can pay for itself through advertising.

   Sophie
   I wouldn't mind paying more for a newspaper if I knew the quality of journalism is good.

   Neil
   But increasingly people are expecting good quality journalism for free.

   Sophie
   Newspapers have been around since the invention of the printing press, and as chronicles – or written accounts – of people's lives, are an
   important historical resource. Let's listen to Alex Cox, researcher at genealogy website, findmypast.co.uk talking more about this.

   INSERT
   Alex Cox, researcher at genealogy website, findmypast.co.uk
   During the First World War local papers always printed In Memoriam columns where they'd list local dead. What a lot of them also did was they
   allowed relatives to submit short poems about their deceased loved ones and some of them were five or six lines – not very long – but they're
   really, really quite powerful. And the paper dedicated page space to print not just one of these, but multiple, and I don't know whether a
   modern paper would even consider doing that today.

   Sophie
   Deceased is another word for dead – in this case, it refers to the British soldiers who died in the First World War.

   Neil
   Local papers, at the time, printed poems written by the families of the dead men. Those poems, captured in print, are an important historical
   record of the time.

   Sophie
   Indeed. Now, remember, Neil, I asked you: How many national print newspapers are currently sold in the UK a day? Is it… a) 70,000, b) 700,000 or
   c) 7 million?

   Neil
   Yes, I remember. And I said 70,000.

   Sophie
   Well, I'm sorry Neil, but you are wrong. The answer is actually c) 7 million. But the numbers are falling.

   Neil
   Well, that's still a few million more than I thought. Now, I think it must be time to hear the words we learned today.
   They are:
   taken in
   fake
   reliable
   feeling the pinch
   objective
   rant
   circulation
   chronicles
   deceased

   Sophie
   Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!

   Both
   Bye!
