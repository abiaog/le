   Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil…

   Alice
   And I'm Alice.

   Neil
   So Alice how did you spend Saturday night?

   Alice
   Curled up on the sofa with a good book. You?

   Neil
   I went out on the town. Met some friends, had a few drinks, then went on to a party.

   Alice
   Well that illustrates the difference between us – you're an extrovert. And I'm… not. And where we are on the spectrum between introvert and
   extrovert is the subject of today's show.

   Neil
   So would you call yourself an introvert, Alice?

   Alice
   No, I'm an ambivert, which means a mixture of introvert and extrovert.

   Neil
   Well, whichever you are, Alice, staying in on your own on a Saturday night is pretty boring!

   Alice
   Not to me. And you shouldn't be so judgemental, Neil. You're reflecting the general view that people seem to have these days, that being an
   introvert is somehow less valuable than being an extrovert. Introverts have many valuable qualities. They're reflective – that means thoughtful
   – and have inner resources. In other words, they don't rely on other people to enjoy themselves.

   Neil
   OK, well if you're feeling reflective at the moment, how about answering today's quiz question?

   Alice
   OK.

   Neil
   Can you tell me: who first used the term 'extrovert'? Was it…
   a) Sigmund Freud?
   b) Friedrich Nietzsche?
   Or c) Carl Jung?

   Alice
   I think the answer is c) Carl Jung.

   Neil
   Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or not later in the show. But before we get there, let's listen to Lisa Kaenzig, researcher and
   Associate Dean for William Smith College, New York State, telling us a bit more about what being an introvert typically means.

   INSERT
   Lisa Kaenzig, researcher and Associate Dean for William Smith College, New York State
   Introverts are people of any age who really get their energy from within themselves. And who often have sort of a running dialogue in their head
   going on thinking before they're talking, like to have a little more time to think through things before they're commenting on them or answering
   a question, need some time to recharge their batteries by being by themselves, and enjoy having alone time.

   Neil
   Lisa Kaenzig there – who says that introverts think about what they're going to say before they say it.

   Alice
   Do you do that, Neil?

   Neil
   Nope!

   Alice
   You should try it sometime. Now, Lisa also talks about the different ways people recharge their batteries – introverts tend to need time alone
   to regain their strength and energy when they're feeling drained – or very tired – whereas extroverts often prefer to recharge by being with
   other people.

   Neil
   So introverts create their energy internally – from within themselves – and extroverts recharge from being with other people.

   Alice
   Exactly. But in some situations, for example at school or in the workplace, things can be made suitable for – extroverts. Extroverts typically
   love being with others – in a big class or an open plan office – where there's a lot going on. They enjoy the external stimulation. But
   introverts can find these big, noisy environments uncomfortable.

   Neil
   I can see that. And these days, people are wild about group work and brainstorming – job ads frequently ask if you are a people person, a team
   player … and so on.

   Alice
   That's right. Introverts like to work alone or in small groups and need a quieter space to perform well. Let's listen now to Dr Peter Aloka, a
   researcher and psychologist in Kenya. He's been working with introvert teenage mothers in Bondo who are returning to school after having their
   babies. And schools are being asked to develop new strategies to support their learning.

   INSERT
   Dr Peter Aloka, psychologist, Bondo, Kenya
   Introverts might find it easier working in groups, but with smaller groups, and they work in pairs with extroverts… The teachers should design a
   classroom for all the students too, to contribute. Whenever a teacher is teaching a question in class let them allow for wait time for students
   to process the information before answering the question. Just for people to think through that question. Thinking, pairing, and sharing: those
   three strategies will help the introverts to speak out.

   Neil
   Dr Peter Aloka is talking about some very clever pairing there. If you put two introverts together they might not say anything. An extrovert is
   likely to talk, but won't intimidate – or overpower – their introvert partner as much as a large group would.

   Alice
   So the idea is that with fewer people – in a small group or a pair – the introvert will have enough time and space to express their ideas. And
   because their ideas have been thought through – or carefully considered – , their contribution is likely to be worth waiting for. So… Think.
   Pair. Share.

   Neil
   Hmm. I like that. OK, so I think it's time to share the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: who first used the term ‘extrovert'? Was it…
   a) Sigmund Freud?
   b) Friedrich Nietzsche?
   Or c) Carl Jung?

   Alice
   I said… Carl Jung.

   Neil
   And you were… right, Alice. So thinking things through really works! ‘Introvert' and ‘extrovert' are the two basic personality types according
   to the theories of the 20th-century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. According to these theories, an introvert is a person whose interest lies with
   their own feelings and thoughts, in contrast to an extrovert, whose interest lies with other people and the outside world.

   Alice
   OK. Now, let's hear the words we learned today:
   ambivert
   reflective
   inner resources
   recharge their batteries
   drained
   intimidate
   thought through
