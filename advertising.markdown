#   January 24, 2015 by Liz 151 Comments

   This lesson focuses on essential advertising vocabulary. There is also an audio so you can listen to how the words are pronounced. At the bottom
   of the page, is some practice exercises to learn how to use these words correctly. Advertising is a common topic in both IELTS speaking and
   writing task 2, so you must learn all the basic vocabulary to be able to talk and write on this topic.

   This lesson contains a lot of vocabulary. Take your time to learn the words and practice your pronunciation. There is an audio under each table
   for pronunciation practice.

   Forms of the word:

     * ad (n)
     * advert (n)
     * advertise (vb)
     * advertising (v+ing)
     * advertisement (n) (there are two different pronunciation – UK and USA)

## Main Types of Advertisements:
TV commercial = Promotion of products and services using colour, 


## Other Types of Advertisements:


## More Types of Advertising:


    

    Practice Exercises with Advertising Vocabulary

   Use the vocabulary above to complete the sentences. Words may be used more than once.

    1. I think I prefer …………….. because they are really good fun to watch and often have a catchy tune or song to go with them.
    2. Last night, I was just sitting down to my favourite series on TV when the phone rang. It was another …………. I find them really annoying.
    3. Personally, I think that …………………… in movies is the most effective because you aren’t even aware that you are being targeted by a company
       while you’re watching.
    4. I think ………………… are a great way to advertise because they are so entertaining but I guess they must be very costly to put on, particularly at
       peak viewing time.
    5. There’s nothing more annoying than trying to work online and getting bothered by ………………
    6. I hardly ever pay attention to adverts in the ………………….. because they aren’t usually very attractive but whenever I flick through a …………….,
       I’m constantly drawn towards their beautiful, glossy ads.
    7. I find telesales quite ……………….. because they call your home to sell you something. I think it’s an invasion of privacy.

                      I do not have tests, I have practice exercises to develop skills. Therefore, try one full practice test from the Cambridge
                      book and then do some exercises to improve.

       Hello,
       I would like to know if I use the same sentences you have written here at my ielts exam, is it ok with the examiner or not? will I lose score
       by using exact sentences from books or websites like yours?
       Thank you,

            It’s never a good idea to memorise sentences. Because the memorised sentences will be 100% correct but your own sentences will contain
            mistakes. The examiner will notice the difference. As a result, you will be marked down. You can use ideas and vocabulary but not
            sentences or chunks of language. See this page: http://ieltsliz.com/ielts-writing-tips-sentences-to-avoid/

            My recommendation is to get one ( or all) of my advanced writing task 2 lessons: http://subscriptions.viddler.com/IELTSLizStore. There
            are two reasons why students don’t get the band score they need. One reason is that they make too many mistakes in their grammar and
            vocabulary. That means you must always aim for accuracy and not attempt to impress the examiner. The other reason is not understanding
            what the examiner is looking for and the techniques requires by IELTS – in this case, my advanced lessons are the key. For writing task
            1, you need to read more about the band scores and what is important in your report:
            http://ieltsliz.com/ielts-writing-task-1-band-scores/ Make sure you spend time learning how to write overviews. Go through all posts on

            To get band 7, you will need a higher level of English. Tips help with the test but if your level of English is too low, you will not
            get band 7. Work on your English before aiming for band 7.

            Haha I’ve been only studing the English for 1 year and got the 7 score in speaking even thought my vocabulary wasn’t so rich and
            precise(but I got less than 5.5 in the rest moduels thought).I would recomend you to watch more TV shows and try just reapit after them
            in the same time.And another fact tot speack fluently is to learn the banal worlds by heart and deeply so that you may use then in any
            world struckture that tears off from your mind.

       Hi Liz,

       I just wanted to drop in after having dropped in months ago to say thanks. Most importantly, I managed to achieve an overall of band 9
       finally (needed an 8 across all categories but kept managing a ruddy 7.5 countless times for writing). I loved your website, your lovely
       friendly profile picture (simple things matter eh!), and even the forums full of questions by other students that calmed my anxiety. I now
       pass your site on to many students who I also teach to help them across the line for IELTS 🙂

       Big Hugs,

            Hi Lils,

            Congratulations for scoring so well. Band 9 seems a lot of hard work.
            I would like some tips from you as i have less than a month for my IELTS and i need a band 8 or 7.5 for my admission and scholarship.
            would you like to help .

            Regards,
            Sehar

       I think you are wonderful , I have written my IELTS two times with speaking 7, writing 6.5, Reading 5.5. It was a surprise to me because I
       was thinking that I will get band 7 on all but going through your teachings, I knew why I failed. I am going to write another IELTS on 12th
       December, hoping that I will do well as my aim is to get band 8 on the three.

            Here’s a link to how to improve your reading score: http://ieltsliz.com/ielts-reading-tips-how-can-i-improve-my-score/. For advanced
            writing task 2 lessons see my online lessons: http://subscriptions.viddler.com/IELTSLizStore. However, also consider spending time
            reviewing your English. To get band score 8, the majority of your sentences for speaking and writing need to be complex and error free.
            Good luck!

       Hy Ma’am,

       I have been following your website and youtube lessons for quite some time I know and find them immensely helpful, so, a BIG THANKS for all
       your efforts!
       However, I am struggling and infact, I am quite afraid of the speaking test since this is my first attempt. I can’t find someone to talk to.
       I am recording my voice and checking my speech for errors that you have mentioned. Is there any other method by which I can improve my
       speaking and at least get a band score 7 in speaking?

       Last thing I would like to ask, which pronunciation will the IELTS Examiner judge me for, like US and U.K have different pronunciations for
       same words so which one of them should I practice? I will be appearing on the 8th of October and I am applying for U.S.A .

       Thanks,
       Ansur.

            It is common for students to take the test more than once. The first time, they discover more about the pressures of the test, the
            format and also about their own weaknesses. After that, you should make a list of things you really need to improve – specific things.
            Once you are improved and more confident, book the test again. Don’t forget you can also buy individual writing task 2 lessons if you
            need more help from my writing course – there’s a link in the right hand side column.
            Good luck!

       Hi Liz,
       I find your writing tips and vocabulary lists really useful and want to print them out and carry them with me so I can go through them when
       time is available e.g. on the bus , waiting for someone etc. However, it seems printing ur materials is disallowed. I understand this is
       copyright protection, but it is rather impractical if I need to copy everything out by hand since it is not just a word or two but pages and
       pages and pages. Could I ask if there is a way to print them out for my own reference?
       Thank you.

            complete them.

                 Start making a word list. To learn words, you need to use them. This means practice putting them into sentences when you answer
                 questions, practice spelling them and practice using them in writing. Also start reading more. The more you see words in context,
                 the more you will remember. Don’t forget that you should not aim to learn 20 words in one day but rather learn 5 words very very
                 well.

            Firstly, there are NO questions in part 2. There are guidelines for the content of your talk. You should use your 1 min to think about
            what you will talk about and what extra information you will add. You can add information about people, past experience, future hopes,
            buildings, streets, activities, weather, food etc. You can add any information to your talk to make it more interesting and to show the
            examiner the range of your language. Ever time you speak is a chance to show your English. See my speaking page for more tips.

            all model answers. Think about techniques. Also start writing a word list of paraphrases from the practice listening and reading lessons

            You must review all information pages for each section, review band score information, review model answers and also techniques. Then
            you must review your English language. To get band 7, you should have few errors in vocabulary and grammar. Take your next test when
            your practice test scores are at the band score you require.

            If your English is not good, you should wait until your level is better to do IELTS. If you want band score 6, you should have only some
            errors in English with enough language to talk about most topics. If you want band 7, you should make few errors and have a very good
            range of language for all topics.

            The problem is your level of English. You have too many errors for band 7. Work on your English to build more accuracy before you book
            another test.
            All the best
            Liz

            Liz, you are amazing. I have never experienced a great and a sincer teacher like you. Publishing and sharing your knowledge without any
            cupidity is marvellous becuase this is effectively going to help all of us to get higher band score. I am struggling with the words to
            admire your efforts and contribution that is the very focused and to the point for IELTS. You are great and world would hardly find
            people like you who are really dedicated and stunning. Wish you all the best.

            Grammar is 25% of your marks for speaking and writing and plays a role in listening and reading. You just need to learn tenses, sentence
            structures, articles, plurals etc. Visit a grammar website and start learning. You’ll find a link to one in the IELTS Extra Section on
            the Useful Website Page.

       In exercise sentence no. 3, does the answer ‘covert advertisements’ match with ‘is the most effective’ gramatically?

            Most students can’t finish on time for two reasons: 1. they make lots of mistakes while they write and spend time fixing them 2. they
            change their ideas and need to think of ideas and get stuck. For both reasons, the solution is planning. If you have each paragraph and
            all supporting points, the writing will come easier and faster. Also practice is necessary.

       I gained most of my knowledge concerning ielts from your website , only one thing kept me curious, what benifet would you gain from making
       this huge effort
       your videos are outstanding and really adress the issue perfectly . Again all of your lessons are well presented and easily understandable
       the question is , are we getting all of this for free
       something hard to believe, I dont know how to thank you.
