   Pangolins

   baby-pangolin

   A) Pangolins, often called “scaly anteaters,” are covered in tough, overlapping scales. These burrowing mammals eat ants and
   termites using an extraordinarily long, sticky tongue, and are able to quickly roll themselves up into a tight ball when
   threatened. Eight different pangolin species can be found across Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Poaching for illegal wildlife trade
   and habitat loss have made these incredible creatures one of the most endangered groups of mammals in the world.

   B) Pangolin species vary in size from about 1.6kg (~3.5 lbs) to a maximum of about 33kg (~73 lbs). They vary in color from light
   to yellowish brown through olive to dark brown. Protective, overlapping scales cover most of their bodies. These scales are made
   from keratin — the same protein that forms human hair and finger nails. Overlapping like artichoke leaves, the scales grow
   throughout the life of a pangolin just like hair; scale edges are constantly filed down as pangolins dig burrows and tunnel
   through the soil in search of termites and ants. Pangolin undersides do not have scales, and are covered with sparse fur. Unlike
   African pangolins, Asian pangolins also have thick bristles that emerge from between their scales. With small conical heads and
   jaws lacking teeth, pangolins have amazingly long, muscular, and sticky tongues that are perfect for reaching and lapping up ants
   and termites in deep cavities. Pangolins have poor vision, so they locate termite and ant nests with their strong sense of smell.

   C) There are eight pangolin species. All pangolins belong to the genus Manis in the family Manidae, which is the only family
   within the order Pholidota. Pangolins’ closest living relatives are the Xenarthrans – anteaters, armadillos, and sloths.

   D) Pangolins are found in a variety of habitats including tropical and flooded forests, thick brush, cleared and cultivated
   areas, and savannah grassland; in general they occur where large numbers of ants and termites are found. Asian pangolins in
   particular are threatened by loss of habitat due to expanding agriculture and other human uses. Pangolins dig deep burrows for
   sleeping and nesting that contain circular chambers. Large chambers have been discovered in terrestrial pangolin burrows that
   were big enough for a human to crawl inside and stand up. Some pangolin species such as the Malayan pangolin also sleep in the
   hollows and forks of trees and logs.

   E) These solitary mammals are nocturnal and highly secretive, thus it is difficult for scientists to study them in the wild, and
   many mysteries remain about their habits. Some pangolin species such as the Chinese pangolin sleep in underground burrows during
   the day, and others including African tree pangolins and Malayan pangolins are known to sleep in trees. They emerge in the
   evening to forage for insects. Pangolins are well adapted for digging: they dig burrows with their strong front legs and claws,
   using their tails and rear legs for support and balance. Tunneling underground, they excavate the sides and roofs of passages by
   pushing up and from side to side with their tough scaled bodies. They use their front and hind feet to back accumulated soil
   toward the burrow entrance, and vigorously kick dirt out of the entrance up to a meter or more. Pangolin scales provide good
   defense against predators. When threatened, pangolins can quickly curl into a ball, protecting their defenseless undersides. They
   also deter predators by hissing and puffing, and lashing their sharp edged tails.

   F) Pangolins live predominantly on a diet of ants and termites, which they may supplement with various other invertebrates
   including bee larvae, flies, worms, earthworms, and crickets. This specialist diet makes them extremely difficult to maintain in
   captivity—they often reject unfamiliar insect species or become ill when fed foreign food. Wild pangolins locate insect nests
   using a well developed sense of smell. Voraciously digging ants and termites from mounds, stumps, and fallen logs with their
   claws, they use their extremely long sticky tongues to capture and eat them.

   G) Pangolins are hunted for food, for use in traditional medicine and as fashion accessories, and for a rampant illegal
   international trade in scales, skins, and meat. There is high demand for nearly all of their body parts, principally from China.
   The large-scale illegal trade in Asian pangolins is drastically driving down their numbers throughout Southeast Asia. Rapid loss
   and deterioration of available habitat places added pressure on the dwindling numbers of remaining pangolins.

Matching Headings Question: IELTS Reading

   January 13, 2015 by Liz 32 Comments

   In this question you must match the correct heading to the correct section of the passage. Matching headings questions are common
   in IELTS reading and are one of the longest to complete. Take time to read through the headings given. Which which ones are
   similar  or contain similar language – they are often traps. Also check the number of headings given, usually there are more
   headings available than are needed.

   The heading usually relates to the general aim of a section.

   Antimicrobial Resistance

   A) While antibiotic resistance refers specifically to the resistance to antibiotics that occurs in common bacteria that cause
   infections, antimicrobial resistance is a broader term, encompassing resistance to drugs to treat infections caused by other
   microbes. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is resistance of a microorganism to an antimicrobial drug that was originally effective
   for treatment of infections caused by it. Resistant microorganisms (including bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites) are able to
   withstand attack by antimicrobial drugs, such as antibacterial drugs (e.g., antibiotics), antifungals, antivirals, and
   antimalarials, so that standard treatments become ineffective and infections persist, increasing the risk of spread to others.
   The evolution of resistant strains is a natural phenomenon that occurs when microorganisms replicate themselves erroneously or
   when resistant traits are exchanged between them. The use and misuse of antimicrobial drugs accelerates the emergence of
   drug-resistant strains. Poor infection control practices, inadequate sanitary conditions and inappropriate food-handling
   encourages the further spread of AMR.

   B) New resistance mechanisms emerge and spread worldwide threatening our ability to treat common infectious diseases, resulting
   in death and disability of individuals who until recently could continue a normal course of life. Without effective
   anti-infective treatment, many standard medical treatments will fail or turn into very high risk procedures. This would be a
   financially draining situation for wealth countries but for the poorer ones, it could have catastrophic effects.

   C) Infections caused by resistant microorganisms often fail to respond to the standard treatment, resulting in prolonged illness,
   higher health care expenditures, and a greater risk of death. As an example, the death rate for patients with serious infections
   caused by common bacteria treated in hospitals can be about twice that of patients with infections caused by the same
   non-resistant bacteria. For example, people with MRSA (another common source of severe infections in the community and in
   hospitals) are estimated to be 64% more likely to die than people with a non-resistant form of the infection.

   D) WHO’s report on global surveillance of antimicrobial resistance reveals that antibiotic resistance is no longer a prediction
   for the future; it is happening right now, across the world, and is putting at risk the ability to treat common infections in the
   community and hospitals. Without urgent, coordinated action, the world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era, in which common
   infections and minor injuries, which have been treatable for decades, can once again kill.

   Questions 1-4

   Choose the correct heading from the list below (i-x)

   Choose the correct heading for sections A-D from the list of headings below.

   i. A fatal threat

   ii. A global concern.

   iii. The evolution of resistance

   iv. MRSA in hospitals

   v. The present situation

   vi. What is antimicrobial resistance?

   vii. Protecting future generations

    1. Section A =
    2. Section B =
    3. Section C =
    4. Section D =

   Answers

    1. vi
    2. ii
    3. i
    4. v

   (passage adapted from WHO)

   Vocabulary

     * broader term = a more general term
     * encompassing = including
     * persist = continue
     * phenomenon = occurrence
     * replicate = copy / reproduce
     * erroneously = mistakenly
     * sanitary = hygienic  / clean
     * catastrophic = disastrous / terrible / devastating
     * prolonged = lengthy (prolonged illness = chronic illness)

IELTS Reading: Matching Headings

   August 6, 2014 by Liz

   Practice IELTS reading matching  headings by understanding how  paraphrasing will help  you find the right  answer. You will  see
   there are two paragraphs but 6 possible  headings. Read the headings first and then  read the article to decide which heading  is
   the right one for each paragraph.

                                                      Tips for Matching Headings

     * Spend time paraphrasing the possible headings
     * Read the paragraphs to find the main idea
     * Distinguish between main ideas and extra information in the paragraph
     * Match main ideas not vocabulary
     * Not all headings will be used
     * Your answer must be a numeral (for example, i or v1) not words.

                                                      Matching Headings Practice

   Choose the correct heading for paragraphs A & B from the list of headings below.

   i. Temperatures on earth

   ii. What is a greenhouse

   iii. How is earth a greenhouse

   iv. Plants that grow in a greenhouse

   v. Earth’s atmosphere

   vi. Why people have greenhouses

    The greenhouse effect

   A.   A greenhouse  is a house made  of glass. It has  glass walls and a  glass roof. People grow  tomatoes and flowers and  other
   plants in them. A greenhouse stays warm inside, even during winter.  Sunlight shines in and warms the plants and air inside.  But
   the heat is trapped by the glass and cannot escape. So during the daylight hours, it gets warmer and warmer inside a  greenhouse,
   and stays quite warm at night too.

   B.   Earth’s atmosphere does the same thing as the greenhouse. Gases in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide do what the roof of
   a greenhouse does. During the  day, the Sun shines through  the atmosphere. Earth’s surface warms  up in the sunlight. At  night,
   Earth’s surface cools, releasing  the heat back into  the air. But  some of the heat  is trapped by the  greenhouse gases in  the
   atmosphere. That is what keeps our Earth a warm and comfortable 59 degrees Fahrenheit, on average.

   Answers

   Paragraph A = ii

   Explanation: The passage is about the greenhouse effect so the first paragraph explains the meaning of the word greenhouse.  This
   is shown in the topic sentence and explained in the  following sentences. The first paragraph does give information about  plants
   in a greenhouse (iv) but this is only an example of how a greenhouse is used and not the aim of the paragraph.

   Paragraph B = iii

   Explanation: The second paragraph explains that earth functions the same way as a greenhouse due to gases in the atmosphere. This
   is shown in the  topic sentence. There  is information about  the temperatures on earth  (i) but only  to explain the  greenhouse
   effect. Also there is information about earth’s atmosphere (v) but only as it relates to the greenhouse effect.

   The above article was taken from wiki.
